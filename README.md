# Terminal

- You can use this script to change your xfce4-terminal background everytime you open a new terminal.
- Change the `$path` variable to your folder of images.
- Add this script to your respective `rc` file if bash then `.bashrc` if zsh then `.zshrc`. (Make sure to give execute permission)
- e.g.
```bash
    $HOME/Desktop/change # You can add this line at the end of your rc file but make sure to add the correct path to your file
```
- You can also use some of my ![images](terminal).
